# AI Evolution Pyramid Visualization

This project visualizes the evolution of artificial intelligence from Narrow AI (ANI) to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) to Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) using a 3D pyramid.

## Features

- Interactive 3D pyramid visualization using Three.js
- Detailed information about each AI level
- Responsive design that works on various screen sizes
- Orbital controls to rotate and zoom the pyramid

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- Three.js for 3D rendering

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser
2. Use your mouse to interact with the 3D pyramid:
   - Click and drag to rotate the view
   - Scroll to zoom in and out
3. Read the information panel on the left for details about each AI level

## AI Levels Explained

### ANI (Artificial Narrow Intelligence)

Task-specific AI systems designed for singular purposes. Examples include voice assistants, recommendation systems, facial recognition, and self-driving cars.

### AGI (Artificial General Intelligence)

Human-level intelligence with the ability to understand, learn, and apply knowledge across a wide range of tasks. Can think, comprehend, and solve complex problems like humans.

### ASI (Artificial Superintelligence)

AI that surpasses human intelligence in all aspects. Can perform any task better than humans, with the ability to develop its own emotions, beliefs, and experiences.
